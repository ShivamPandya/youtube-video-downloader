# youtube-video-downloader

This is simple python script, written to download any music* video from youtube.

I've used youtube-dl and beautifulsoup, additionally I've used urllib to get the links and to request the search.

Program requests the YouTube search and selects the top result(as for most youtube video the first search is the most relevant)
